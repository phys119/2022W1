We have done so below for a mock dataset of voltages and currents. It is worth noting that this issue is one of great general interest in science. We may have two variables which are related (here the potential $V$ and current $I$ through a circuit) and a model that describes how they may be related (here, Ohm's law). What we can do as experimental scientists is to collect data of the two variables and try to fit a model to them; from this we may extract parameters of interest (here, the resistance of our circuit), as well as evaluate how good the model is at describing the phenomena we see.\n",
