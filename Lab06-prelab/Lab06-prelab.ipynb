    "Below is the experimental data for the position vs. time of a different toy car. Following the procedure as we covered in the above worked example (and in the tutorial), use the residual plot to determine the best fit model parameters and their uncertainties; from this conclude the initial position and speed of the toy car.\n",

    "2. Using the residuals plot, adjust the slope and the y-intercept values until you see no trend in the residuals. This will give you the best fit slope $m_{\\text{best}}$ and y-intercept $b_{\\text{best}}$. \n",
    "3. Increase the slope/decrease the y-intercept to the extent possible where the model still fits the data reasonably well (as evaluated by the residuals). From this obtain $m_{\\text{max}}$ and $b_{\\text{min}}$. Analogously, obtain $m_{\\text{min}}$ and $b_{\\text{max}}$ by pushing the model parameters in the opposite direction.\n",
    "4. From $m_{\\text{max}}/m_{\\text{min}}$ and $b_{\\text{max}}/b_{\\text{min}}$, calculate the uncertainties in $m$ and $b$.\n",
    "5. The speed of the car can be identified as the slope of the distance vs. time graph, and the initial position can be identified as the y-intercept of the graph. Given this, report the speed and initial position of the toy car with uncertainty.\n",

    "Note: It is not necessary to copy and paste the same block of plotting code multiple times (this is done in the worked example above so that it is easier to follow); it suffices to have one single block of plotting code that you can run multiple times while changing the parameters inside."
