    "In Lab 08 you will continue to collect data from the RC circuit in an effort to improve your dataset. In addition, this prelab will provide you with an analytic formula for minimizing chi-squared. This formula allows you to **calculate** the best fitting parameters to your data, instead of iteratively searching for the best fit parameters yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a reminder that determining the best fit to your data does not allow you to say \"this is a *good* fit to my data\". The best fit, by definition, is one that minimizes chi-squared. But if your minimized chi-squared is $\\chi^2=11.8$, we now know this is not a good fit to your data. Conversely, if your minimized chi-squared is $\\chi^2=0.05$, then it may be a good fit to the data, but you should take a closer look at our uncertainty estimation strategy as our uncertainties are likely overestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to say that just because the chi-squared minimization process can now be automated in the lab, this does not mean you can discard previous tools like residuals plots and the process of interpreting the minimized chi-squared. We have built up fitting to data in a gradual fashion for you, from uncertainty estimation, to weighted mean, to scatter plots and residuals, to chi-squared calculation, to iterative and now automated chi-squared minimization. This way, you now have a thorough understanding of what goes into each component of determining the best fit, as well as interpreting the goodness of fit in a systematic way."

    "Recall that chi-squared is a continuous function of the fitting parameters in your model. Specifically, if you have $P$ parameters in your model, then chi-squared is a $P$-dimensional function. For instance, if we are fitting a one-parameter linear model, $y=mx$, then $m$ is the sole parameter and the associated chi-squared function is $\\chi^2(m)$. For a two-parameter linear model, $y=mx+b$, then we would have $\\chi^2(m,b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simple model functions like straight lines, we can use calculus to analytically find the best values of the parameters without having to iteratively search for them. Below, we'll work through that calculation for the case of a straight line fit with no intercept. It is not crucial that you understand all the steps here.\n",
    "\n",
    "From your first-year calculus course, you may know that we can take a continuous function $f(x)$ and find the minimum or maximum (a critical point, $x_c$) by taking the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, setting this derivative equal to zero, and solving the resulting equation\n",

    "Since $\\chi^2$ is a continuous function, we can do exactly this process to come up with an expression that automatically calculates the critical point(s), to find the minimum. In other words, we can use calculus to derive an *analytic* expression for the best fit parameter(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE! for those thinking: wait a minute, how do we know the critical point will be a minimum and not a maximum? If we think about fitting a model to data that is finite, we know that as we move the parameters to $+\\infty$ and $-\\infty$ the fit will become increasingly worse to the data, meaning the residuals and thus chi-squared will continue to increase. This means that there is no maximum chi-squared, since we can always make the parameters worse by continuing to move them in the \"wrong\" direction, i.e., away from the best fit value. From this observation is follows that any critical point found must be a minimum.*\n",
